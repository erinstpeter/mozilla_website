	<h1>Whoa. It's a Mozilla Website </h1>

	<p>Here is my picture:</p>
	<img src="http://mdn.github.io/beginner-html-site/images/firefox-icon.png" alt="My test image">

	<p>I never realized that image included a fox in it before...that's embarrasing for these reasons:</p>

	<ul>
		<li> I've used Mozilla for years</li>
		<li>I see this icon often</li>
		<li>Some other reason I can't think of</li>

	</ul>

	<p>Mozilla works to keep the internet alive and accessible.</p>

	<p>Read the <a href="https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/about/manifesto/">Mozilla Manifesto</a> to learn more about what Mozilla does besides make icons that are confusing to me. </p>
